## Abstract

> _This work revisits recent results on maximal multiplicity induced-dominancy for spectral values in reduced-order time-delay Systems and extends it to the general class of second-order retarded differential equations. A parametric multiplicity-induced-dominancy property is characterized, allowing to a delayed stabilizing design with reduced complexity. As a matter of fact, the approach is merely a delayed-output-feedback where the candidates’ delays and gains result from the manifold deﬁning the maximal multiplicity of a real spectral value, then,the dominancy is shown using the argument principle._

The goal of this project is to create and publish a tool capable of generating reduced-order stabilizing command laws for dynamic parametric systems of infinite dimension, using MID properties.

This tool would allow better communication about the capabilities of those new symbolic/numeric methods, as well as the popularization of the partial pole placement strategy in this research domain.

## Online version

Since its creation, P3delta had vocation to be available to the greatest number and on all possible platforms. The current version of the software is available in local executable version, and now the development team wants to propose an online version ready to use in one click. The online version of P3delta is hosted on servers thanks to the Binder service. Binder allows to create instances of personalized computing environment directly from a GitHub repository that can be shared and used by users. The Binder service is free to use and is powered by BinderHub, an open-source tool that deploys the service in the cloud. The online version of P3delta is written in Python and structured as a Jupyter Notebook, an open document format which can contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that could contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. The Jupyter Notebook is completed by a friendly user interface built using interactive widgets from Python's ipywidgets module package.

P3delta online is based on the program and features of the executable version. The first version of the online software includes for the moment features from the Generic MID and Control-oriented MID'modes of P3delta.

When an update has been made on the code, and the team decides to create a new release, follow the instructions in the [tutorial on building the app](Code\Python\TutoBuild.md). (NEED TO UPDATE)

The naming convention “v” followed by “x.y.z” with :

- “x” the major version. Adds BIG changes 
- “y” minor improvements 
- “z” bug fixes or small patches

For example v1.2.4 is the first major release, with 2 releases adding little improvements, and 4 bug fixes on the last one.

## New members

To start working, follow the steps explained [here](https://github.com/Jayvir29/P3delta_Online/blob/main/Start%20Working.md). (NEED TO UPDATE)
